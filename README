The code reads the input .root file(s), which are pre-processed Offline SD simulations.

The python3 environment is locally in python_envs and is activate through activate_env.sh

To execute the code:
source activate_env.sh
python3 main.py <config_file_name>.json

Depending on the type of configuration file that is given as input, different tasks can be performed:

1) Configuration file of type "plot" (e.g. config.json): 
    -A single .root file is given as input
    -The script creates some plots to explore the tree contained in the input file.
    -Plots are saved in the output directory (also set in config.json)

2) Configuration file of type "dataset" (e.g. config_dataset.json)
    -Two .root files corresponding to two different particle are given as inputs
    -The two files are read and processed
    -A .cvs file is created, where the content of the two input files is merged and the events are randomized and labelled (0 for inputfile1, 1 for inputfile2)
